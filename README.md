# Are You Mentally Stable or Just Good at Color-Coding Your Calendar?

This tongue-in-cheek personality quiz mimics a formal psychological evaluation but quickly descends into chaos. Users answer a set of questions meant to expose the cracks behind a perfectly polished persona — and whether that color-coded calendar is a sign of actual stability or just a coping mechanism.
