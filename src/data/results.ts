      oneLiner: "Cries in healthy ways. Feels things *on purpose.* Honestly? Suspicious.",
      description: "📖 You journal, hydrate, and *feel your feelings* like some kind of emotionally literate woodland creature. When your plans fall apart, you reframe. When your boundaries are tested, you enforce them with love. Are you... okay okay? You’re giving 'therapy is working' energy and we love that for you—but you’re scaring the rest of us a little."

      oneLiner: "Emotionally? I’m one missed calendar notification away from crumbling.",
      description: "📖 You give stable, but if someone deleted your Google Drive, you'd cease to exist. You don't have coping skills—you schedule them. You plan breakdowns like they’re meetings, and you treat emotional avoidance like a productivity hack. But hey, at least your disaster is color-coded. Rest is a concept you’re aware of but haven’t had time to download yet."

      id: "Type3",
      name: "The Avoidance CEO✨",
      oneLiner: "If I don’t open the email, it doesn’t exist. That’s quantum physics.",
      description: "📖 You’re not ignoring problems—you’re soft-launching them into the void. You ghost your own emotions, treat 'dissociating' like a hobby, and honestly? You look amazing doing it. Somewhere deep down, your inner child is knocking on a locked door, but you’re too busy rearranging your desktop icons to hear it. Healing is a concept you’ve muted."

      name: "The Notion Necromancer✨",
      oneLiner: "Her morning routine lives in a spreadsheet. She does not.",
      description: "📖 You dream of discipline. You *worship* routines. But you execute them like a cursed Sims character glitching at the fridge. You think the *idea* of structure will fix you, but your execution? A comedy. One day you’ll wake up at 6am, stretch, meditate, and drink water before coffee. That day... is not today. But your color palette is strong, and that’s something."

      id: "Type5",
      name: "The Enlightened Wreck✨",
      oneLiner: "I know I’m unwell, but at least I’ve named the beast.",
      description: "📖 You are emotionally self-aware™ and spiritually hanging on by a claw clip. You spiral with intention. You’re doing the work—but you also confuse 'processing' with sending unhinged voice memos and reading trauma threads at 2am. You know exactly what your red flags are, you just haven’t done anything about them (yet). Honestly? Relatable queen."

      description: "📖 You think you’re coping, but you’re actually just... surviving. You’ve tricked everyone—including yourself—into thinking you're functional, when really you’re one mild inconvenience away from a full reboot. You normalize the abnormal so gracefully it’s giving glam apocalypse. Your house is on fire and you’re like “it’s a little warm in here.” Blink twice if you need a snack and a therapist."
